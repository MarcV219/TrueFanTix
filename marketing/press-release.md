## Toronto Founder Launches Ethical Ticket Marketplace to Combat Scalping

**TrueFanTix Enforces Face-Value Pricing, Creates Closed-Loop Community for Fans**

---

**Toronto, ON – February 2026** – After years of watching tickets disappear in seconds only to reappear at triple the price on resale sites, Toronto-based entrepreneur Marc Villeneuve has launched **TrueFanTix**, a revolutionary ticket marketplace that puts fans first by enforcing one simple rule: **all tickets must be sold at or below face value.**

"The ticketing industry is broken," says Villeneuve, Founder of TrueFanTix. "Bots buy up inventory, professional scalpers treat tickets like commodities, and actual fans—the people these events are made for—get priced out. I got tired of complaining about it, so I built something better."

### A Different Kind of Marketplace

Unlike traditional resale platforms that encourage profit-taking, TrueFanTix uses a combination of price ceilings, mandatory escrow, and an innovative "access token" system to create a fair ecosystem for ticket exchange.

**Key Features:**

- **Face-Value Enforcement**: Platform-level hard caps prevent any listing above original purchase price
- **Mandatory Escrow**: Sellers must transfer tickets to TrueFanTix escrow before listing, preventing fake listings and duplicate sales
- **Zero Seller Fees**: Sellers receive 100% of their listing price; buyers pay an 8.75% admin fee that covers payment processing
- **Access Token System**: Fans who sell tickets to sold-out events earn tokens that grant access to purchase other hard-to-get tickets, creating a closed loop that rewards community participation

### Built by a Fan, for Fans

Villeneuve, a lifelong concert-goer and sports fan, built TrueFanTix after personal experiences with the frustration of modern ticket buying. "I've sat in countless online queues, refreshed screens, and come to the realization that the system was never designed for actual fans—it was designed for quick profit," he explains.

The platform represents a return to an earlier era of ticket exchange, where fans helped other fans attend events they loved, rather than treating tickets as investment vehicles.

### How the Access Token System Works

The platform's unique access token system is designed to reward fans who help other fans:

1. A seller lists a ticket to a sold-out event at or below face value
2. Upon successful sale and transfer, the seller receives 1 access token
3. Access tokens can be used to purchase tickets to other sold-out events
4. Tokens never expire and are only consumed when used for a purchase

"This creates a community of people who help each other instead of competing to extract maximum profit," says Villeneuve. "You can't just buy your way into sold-out shows—you have to earn access by helping other fans first."

### Technical Foundation

TrueFanTix is built on modern web technology, using Next.js, React, and Prisma with a focus on security and user experience. The platform features:

- Secure payment processing through Stripe
- SMS and email verification via Twilio and SendGrid
- Tiered seller verification system
- Comprehensive dispute resolution workflows
- Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go ticket shopping

### Industry Context

The ticket resale industry has faced increasing scrutiny in recent years, with high-profile incidents involving major artists like Taylor Swift drawing attention to the broken nature of ticket distribution. While some primary sellers have attempted to implement fan-friendly features, the underlying economics of the secondary market remain unchanged.

TrueFanTix represents a fundamentally different approach—structural changes that make scalping impossible at the platform level rather than cosmetic improvements to a broken system.

### Availability

TrueFanTix is currently live in beta, serving fans across North America. The platform is actively seeking:

- Beta users to test and refine the experience
- Partnerships with venues, artists, and fan clubs
- Feedback from the fan community on features and improvements

### About TrueFanTix

TrueFanTix is a fan-first ticket marketplace focused on fairness, transparency, and resale at or below face value. Founded in 2026 by Toronto-based entrepreneur Marc Villeneuve, the platform aims to restore trust and accessibility to live events by eliminating scalping and creating a community-driven marketplace.

## Media Pitch Email Template

**Subject**: Story: Toronto founder builds "anti-StubHub" ticket marketplace

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because I think your readers would be interested in a story about a Toronto founder taking on the $10B+ ticket scalping industry.

**The story**: After getting priced out of concerts one too many times, I built TrueFanTix—a ticket marketplace that literally cannot list tickets above face value. No scalpers allowed. Ever.

**Why it's different**:
- Hard price ceiling (platform-enforced, not voluntary)
- Access token system rewards fans who help other fans
- Zero seller fees (buyers pay 8.75% admin fee, sellers keep 100%)
- Mandatory escrow prevents fake listings

**The angle**: Everyone complains about ticket scalping. This is someone actually trying to fix it.

**Why now**: With ongoing controversies around Ticketmaster and scalping, fans are looking for alternatives.

I'd love to chat about:
- The personal story behind building this
- How the access token system works
- Why most "fan-friendly" initiatives fail (and why this might work)
- The technical and business challenges of taking on an entrenched industry

Available for interview anytime this week. Can also provide demo access to the platform.

Best,
Marc Villeneuve
Founder, TrueFanTix

## Interview Preparation

### Key Talking Points:

**The Problem** (30 seconds):
- "The ticketing industry has been exploiting fans for decades"
- "I got priced out of shows one too many times and decided to do something about it"

**The Solution** (30 seconds):
- "TrueFanTix enforces face-value pricing at the platform level"
- "No scalpers, ever. It's structural, not just a policy."

**Why It's Hard** (30 seconds):
- "Everyone says they hate scalping, but the economics favor it"
- "We're choosing mission over margin—long-term trust over short-term profit"

**The Vision** (30 seconds):
- "A world where fans help other fans attend the events they love"
- "Live experiences should be for everyone, not just those who can pay 3x"

### Anticipated Questions & Answers:

**Q: How do you prevent people from lying about face value?**
A: Multiple layers—receipt upload, reputation system, API integrations with primary sellers where possible. Plus, bad actors get banned quickly.

**Q: What's your business model?**
A: Right now we're focused on proving the concept. Long-term, we take an 8.75% admin fee that covers costs. Volume over margin.

**Q: How do you compete with StubHub/Ticketmaster?**
A: We don't. We're for a specific type of user—someone who cares about fairness more than squeezing every dollar out of a transaction.

**Q: What's your biggest challenge?**
A: Inventory. We're new, so we need sellers to list before buyers will come. It's the classic marketplace chicken-and-egg problem.
