## GROUP POST TEMPLATES

---

### TEMPLATE 1: Introduction Post (For Fan Groups)

**Best for**: Large fan groups (1K+ members), concert fan groups, sports fan groups

**When to post**: Wednesday or Thursday evening (7-9 PM), when engagement is highest

**Post**:

> Hey [Group Name]! 👋
> 
> I'm a longtime fan and member of this group, and I wanted to share something I've been building that might help all of us.
> 
> Like many of you, I've been frustrated with ticket prices. We all know the drill: tickets go on sale, the site crashes, and 10 minutes later they're on StubHub for 3x the price. It feels like the system is rigged against actual fans.
> 
> So I built **TrueFanTix**—a ticket marketplace where tickets can ONLY be sold at or below face value.
> 
> **Here's how it's different:**
> ✅ No scalpers allowed (platform-enforced)
> ✅ Mandatory escrow (prevents fake tickets)
> ✅ Sellers keep 100% (buyers pay small admin fee)
> ✅ Access tokens: Help other fans → get access to sold-out shows
> 
> **The catch**: We're new. Small inventory. Growing slowly.
> 
> But if you're tired of paying 3x to see [Artist/Team], we're building an alternative.
> 
> Full transparency: This is my project. I'm not trying to spam—I'm a fan like you who got fed up and decided to do something about it.
> 
> Check it out if you're interested: [link]
> 
> Questions? Ask me anything—I'll be in the comments.
> 
> — Marc
> 
> P.S. If this post breaks any group rules, mods please let me know and I'll remove it. Just trying to help fellow fans. 🤘

### TEMPLATE 2: Value-First Post (For General Discussion)

**Best for**: General music/sports discussion groups

**When to post**: After establishing some presence in the group

**Post**:

> Ticket buying tip that might save you money 💰
> 
> I see a lot of people in this group asking about the best way to get tickets without getting ripped off. Here's what I've learned after years of dealing with this:
> 
> **The scalper playbook:**
> 1. Bots buy up inventory in seconds
> 2. Tickets appear on "secondary markets" minutes later
> 3. Same companies often own both primary AND secondary markets
> 4. You pay 2-4x and they profit on both sides
> 
> **How to protect yourself:**
> ✓ Buy during presales when possible
> ✓ Check multiple sites (prices vary wildly)
> ✓ Verify sellers on resale platforms
> ✓ Use credit cards with purchase protection
> ✓ Consider platforms that enforce fair pricing
> 
> **Full disclosure**: I built TrueFanTix specifically to combat this problem. It's a face-value-only marketplace. Not trying to spam—just genuinely want to help fans avoid getting ripped off.
> 
> If you're interested: [link]
> If not, no worries—hope these tips help either way! 🎫

### TEMPLATE 3: Story-Based Post (Emotional Connection)

**Best for**: Building personal connection, smaller groups

**When to post**: Weekend evenings when people have time to read longer posts

**Post**:

> I need to tell you guys a story about why I built TrueFanTix. It's personal.
> 
> Last year, my favorite band announced a reunion tour. I grew up on their music—literally soundtracked my teenage years. First show in 10 years.
> 
> I set 5 alarms. I was on the site the SECOND tickets went on sale. Queue position: 2,847. Waited 45 minutes.
> 
> "Sold out."
> 
> Heartbroken, I checked StubHub. Same tickets. $400 each. Face value was $85.
> 
> I couldn't afford it. Missed the show that meant everything to me.
> 
> That's when I realized: the system isn't broken—it's working exactly as designed. Just not for fans.
> 
> So I spent the next year building TrueFanTix. A place where:
> • Tickets are at or below face value (enforced)
> • Scalpers literally cannot operate
> • Fans help other fans
> • No one gets priced out of memories
> 
> Is it perfect? No. We're small. Growing. Learning.
> 
> But I'm done complaining about the problem. I'm fixing it.
> 
> If you want to check it out: [link]
> If you want to tell me I'm crazy, I'm here for that too. 😅
> 
> Either way—keep fighting for fair access to live events. We deserve it.
> 
> — Marc, founder and fellow fan

### TEMPLATE 4: Question/Engagement Post

**Best for**: Starting conversations, smaller groups

**When to post**: Anytime, good for ongoing engagement

**Post**:

> Honest question for the group:
> 
> What's the most you've ever overpaid for tickets, and was it worth it?
> 
> I'll start: $300 for $85 tickets. Good seats, great show, but I felt ripped off the whole night.
> 
> The ticketing industry has gotten out of control. I've been working on something to fix it (TrueFanTix—face-value only marketplace), but I'm curious about your experiences.
> 
> What's your ticket buying horror story? 👇

---

### TEMPLATE 5: Event-Specific Post

**Best for**: Timing with major announcements, tour announcements

**When to post**: Immediately after major tour/event announcement

**Post**:

> [ARTIST] just announced their tour! 🎉
> 
> I know we're all excited, but I also know what's coming:
> 
> ❌ Sites crashing
> ❌ "Sold out" in minutes
> ❌ Tickets on StubHub for 3x the price
> ❌ Fans getting priced out
> 
> I'm not going to spam you guys with links, but I did want to offer this:
> 
> If you're looking for tickets to [ARTIST] and want to avoid scalpers, TrueFanTix enforces face-value pricing.
> 
> We're still building up inventory, but we're here as an alternative to the usual gouging.
> 
> Good luck to everyone trying to get tickets! May the queue gods be with you. 🙏
> 
> (Mods: if this is too promotional, happy to remove—just trying to help fellow fans)

## COMMENT RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### When Someone Asks for More Info

> Happy to share more! Here's the basics:
> 
> **For buyers:** Browse tickets at or below face value. No scalper markup ever. 8.75% admin fee covers payment processing.
> 
> **For sellers:** List at/below what you paid. No seller fees—you keep 100%. Sold a sold-out show? Earn access tokens to buy other sold-out shows.
> 
> **The access token thing:** It's designed to reward fans who help other fans. You can't just buy your way into sold-out shows—you earn access by selling face-value tickets first.
> 
> Website: [link]
> 
> Happy to answer any other questions!

### When Someone Is Skeptical

> Totally fair to be skeptical—the ticketing industry has earned that distrust.
> 
> Here's the honest truth:
> - We're new and small (launched recently)
> - Inventory is limited because we're building from scratch
> - We're not trying to replace StubHub overnight
> - We're an alternative for people who care about fairness over convenience
> 
> The model works because we don't try to compete on volume—we compete on values.
> 
> Check it out if you're curious. If not, no worries at all. Just trying to build something better.

### When Someone Shares Their Horror Story

> This is exactly why I built TrueFanTix. Stories like yours are way too common.
> 
> I'm sorry that happened to you. The system is rigged, and it's not fair.
> 
> If you want to try an alternative for future shows, we're here. If you just needed to vent, I hear you—and I'm with you.
> 
> We deserve better than this as fans.
