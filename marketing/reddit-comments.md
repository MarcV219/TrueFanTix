# Sample Reddit Comments & Posts

## GENERAL ENGAGEMENT (Be Helpful First)

---

### r/tickets - Response to "Why are resale prices so high?"

**Context**: Someone asking why ticket resale is so expensive

**Comment**:
> The short answer: because they can be.
> 
> The ticketing industry is broken. Primary sellers (Ticketmaster, etc.) have a monopoly. Bots scoop up inventory within seconds. Then those tickets appear on "secondary markets"—which are often owned by the SAME companies—at 2-4x markups.
> 
> It's not supply and demand. It's supply manipulation.
> 
> I'm building something different (disclosure: it's my project). TrueFanTix forces all listings at or below face value. No scalpers allowed. Escrow system prevents fake listings.
> 
> Is it perfect? No. Is it an alternative to getting ripped off? Absolutely.
> 
> Happy to answer questions if anyone's curious about how we're trying to fix this.

### r/ConcertTickets - Response to "Best way to sell extra tickets?"

**Context**: Someone looking to sell tickets they can't use

**Comment**:
> Depends on your priorities:
> 
> **If you want maximum profit**: StubHub, SeatGeek, etc. You'll pay 15-20% in fees and contribute to the scalping problem, but you'll get the most money.
> 
> **If you want to help another fan**: I'd suggest TrueFanTix (my platform, full disclosure). You can only list at or below face value, there are no seller fees, and you get paid 100% of what you list for. Plus if it's a sold-out show, you earn access tokens to buy other hard-to-get tickets.
> 
> The access token system is designed to reward people who help other fans instead of profiting off them.
> 
> Either way—please don't scalp. Someone else wants to make memories at that show.

### r/AskTO - Response to "Best way to get Raptors tickets?"

**Context**: Toronto-specific, sports tickets

**Comment**:
> Toronto fan here! Options:
> 
> 1. **Ticketmaster** - Official, but fees are brutal and resale is integrated (confusing)
> 2. **StubHub** - Reliable but you'll pay scalper prices
> 3. **Gametime** - Good for last-minute, still pricey
> 4. **TrueFanTix** - Full disclosure, I built this. Face value or below only. No scalpers.
> 
> Pro tip: If you're buying resale, always check the seat on the Scotiabank Arena map first. Some "deals" are obstructed view or in the corner.
> 
> Also—Tuesday and Thursday games are usually cheaper than weekends.

### r/Music - General Post (When relevant discussion happening)

**Comment**:
> The ticketing industry has been exploiting fans for decades and it's only getting worse.
> 
> I got fed up and built TrueFanTix—a marketplace that actually enforces face-value pricing. No exceptions.
> 
> **How we're different:**
> - Hard price ceiling (platform-enforced)
> - Mandatory escrow (prevents fake listings)
> - Access token system (sell to sold-out shows → earn access to other sold-out shows)
> - No seller fees (buyers pay 8.75% admin fee, sellers keep 100%)
> 
> **The catch**: We're new. Small inventory. Growing slowly.
> 
> But if you're tired of paying 3x for tickets to see your favorite band, we're building an alternative.
> 
> I'm the founder—happy to answer any questions about how it works, why I built it, or what we're planning next.

## STANDALONE POSTS (Subreddit-Specific)

---

### r/tickets - Standalone Introduction Post

**Title**: I built a ticket marketplace that bans scalping. Here's how it works.

**Post**:
> Hey r/tickets,
> 
> I'm Marc, a music fan and founder of TrueFanTix. After getting priced out of shows one too many times, I built something different.
> 
> **The One Rule**: All tickets must be listed at or below face value.
> 
> No exceptions. No "market pricing." If you want to profit off tickets, go to StubHub. We're for fans who want to help other fans.
> 
> **How It Actually Works:**
> 
> Sellers:
> - List at/below what you paid
> - Transfer to escrow (proves you have the tickets)
> - Get paid 100% of listing price when delivered
> - Sold a sold-out show? Earn access tokens for other sold-out shows
> 
> Buyers:
> - Browse verified listings
> - Never pay more than face value + 8.75% platform fee (covers Stripe/processing)
> - Tickets held in escrow until transfer complete
> - Sold-out shows require access tokens (earned by selling to sold-out shows)
> 
> **The Access Token Thing Explained:**
> 
> This is the engine that makes it work. You can't just buy tickets to sold-out shows—you have to earn access by helping other fans first. Sell one ticket to a sold-out show, get one token. One token = buy one sold-out ticket.
> 
> It creates a community of people who help each other instead of competing to extract maximum profit.
> 
> **Current Status:**
> 
> - Live in beta
> - Toronto-based but works anywhere
> - Limited inventory (we're new)
> - Looking for feedback, users, and partners
> 
> **Why I'm Posting:**
> 
> Not to spam. This community understands the problem better than anyone. I'm looking for honest feedback on whether this model could work at scale.
> 
> Also looking for:
> - Beta testers (try it, break it, tell me what sucks)
> - Venues/artists who want an ethical resale partner
> - Developers who want to help fix ticketing
> 
> Happy to answer questions. Brutal honesty appreciated.
> 
> — Marc

### r/indieheads - Targeted Post

**Title**: For anyone tired of paying 3x to see their favorite indie bands

**Post**:
> The indie scene is supposed to be different. But even small venues get hit by scalpers now.
> 
> I built TrueFanTix specifically to combat this. Face-value-only marketplace.
> 
> **Why indie fans specifically:**
> 
> 1. These shows matter more (smaller venues, intimate experiences)
> 2. Fans are more community-oriented
> 3. Scalping hurts more when it's your favorite small band
> 
> **How we're trying to help:**
> - No scalper markup, ever
> - Escrow system (no fake tickets)
> - Access tokens: help other fans → get access to hard shows
> 
> We're new. We're small. But we're building something different.
> 
> If you're an indie fan in Toronto (or anywhere), check us out. If you think it's a stupid idea, tell me why—genuinely want to know.
> 
> — Marc, founder & fellow indie music obsessive

## RESPONSE TEMPLATES (For Common Questions)

---

### "How do you make money?"

> Great question—we don't, really. Not yet.
> 
> Buyers pay an 8.75% admin fee that covers:
> - Stripe payment processing (~3%)
> - Server costs
> - Dispute resolution reserves
> 
> The margin is thin. Volume is the play—if we can process enough transactions, the admin fees cover operations and growth.
> 
> Long-term, we might explore:
> - B2B partnerships (venues pay to be official resale partner)
> - Premium features for power sellers
> 
> But the core mission (face-value-only) never changes. That's non-negotiable.

---

### "How do you prevent fake tickets?"

> Two layers:
> 
> 1. **Mandatory escrow**: Sellers must transfer tickets to our escrow before listing. This proves they actually have them.
> 
> 2. **Reputation system**: Sellers build score based on successful transactions. New sellers get limited exposure until they prove themselves.
> 
> 3. **Dispute resolution**: If a buyer receives a bad ticket, we investigate. Bad actors get banned. Good sellers get promoted.
> 
> Is it foolproof? No. But it's significantly better than Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace where anyone can list anything with zero verification.

---

### "What about Ticketmaster's 'verified resale'?"

> Ticketmaster owns both the primary market AND the secondary market. Their "verified resale" is just their own scalping operation with better branding.
> 
> They charge fees on both sides of the transaction. They profit whether you buy from them directly or from their resale marketplace.
> 
> We're independent. No conflicts of interest. Just fans helping fans.
