- Marc clarified workflow preference:
  - Primary machine is Windows PC.
  - Commands for this project are run on the Linux MiniPC via SSH.
  - Give explicit, non-technical instructions with clear location context (where to run each command).
  - Be explicit about when a tunnel is needed and exactly which tunnel/URL to use.
