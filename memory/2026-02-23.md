- Marc clarified workflow preference:
  - Primary machine is Windows PC.
  - Commands for this project are run on the Linux MiniPC via SSH.
  - Give explicit, non-technical instructions with clear location context (where to run each command).
  - Be explicit about when a tunnel is needed and exactly which tunnel/URL to use.

- Deployment lesson (TrueFanTix on Vercel):
  - Vercel production build is strict TypeScript and currently rejects many implicit `any` callback params.
  - This environment's Prisma client typing/export surface can differ (several enum namespace exports like `OrderStatus`, `TicketStatus`, `TicketVerificationStatus`, `ForumVisibility`, and `Prisma` namespace imports failed in build-time type checks).
  - Safe pattern for this repo right now when fixing deploy blockers:
    - Prefer string status literals over Prisma enum imports in API routes/scripts.
    - Add explicit callback param types (`: any` where needed) for `map/filter/transaction` callbacks to satisfy strict TS quickly.
    - Run `npm run typecheck` in `truefantix-web` before pushing to reduce iterative Vercel failures.
