# 2026-02-18 - TrueFanTix Development Progress

## Completed Today

### 1. GitHub Integration & Workflow
- Set up GitHub repo: MarcV219/TrueFanTix
- Configured direct push workflow (no PR approvals needed for solo project)
- Added Brave Search API key for dynamic image fetching

### 2. Image System Overhaul
- Implemented automated image fetching from web using Brave Search API
- Created reliable image filtering to avoid hotlink-blocked sites (Getty, Shutterstock, etc.)
- Prioritized reliable sources: Wikimedia, Amazon, IMDb, official sports sites
- Set up category-specific placeholders: basketball, hockey, baseball, football, soccer, concert, theatre, comedy, opera, gala, workshop, conference, festival
- Fixed image display on main page, tickets listing, and ticket detail pages

### 3. Ticket System Improvements
- Fixed event type detection: Raptors→Basketball, Leafs→Hockey, Blue Jays→Baseball
- Updated pricing logic: Sold out tickets now show "Face Value" instead of "Below Face Value"
- Fixed BigInt serialization errors on ticket detail pages

### 4. Footer Pages UI Fixes
- Fixed hero section text colors (was invisible - same color as background)
- Changed from CSS variable `var(--tft-navy)` to explicit `#064a93`
- Updated all 15+ footer pages with proper text colors
- Pages: Our Story, How it Works, Why Face Value, Trust & Safety, FAQ (all), Terms, Privacy, Pricing Policy, Community Guidelines

### 5. Forum Functionality
- Added auth state detection (logged in vs logged out)
- Logged in users see: "New Discussion" button, reply buttons, full composer
- Logged out users see: "Sign In" prompts and links
- Fixed syntax errors (operator precedence with ?? and ||)
- Fixed empty threads not showing reply boxes

### 6. Technical Fixes
- Fixed server port conflicts (3000 vs 3001)
- Configured server to listen on all interfaces (0.0.0.0) for network access
- Multiple server restarts for changes
- Git commits and pushes throughout the day

## Server Status
- Running at: http://192.168.2.104:3000
- Backend: Next.js with Turbopack
- Database: SQLite with Prisma
- Image API: Brave Search

## Remaining Tasks
- Ollama model switching (in progress - auth profile added, needs Gateway restart)
- Dashboard automation (already set up with cron)
- Testing all features end-to-end

## Key Decisions
- Using direct IP access (192.168.2.104:3000) instead of SSH tunnel for stability
- Git workflow: Direct pushes to main, no PRs (appropriate for solo development)
- Image strategy: Web search first, category placeholders as fallback
